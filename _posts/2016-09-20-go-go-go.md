I've recently started to learn [Go](https://golang.org/) and it seems to have a rapidly growing [user-base](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GoUsers) that contains big-hitters.

The learning curve was surprisingly shallow and the more I play, the more I like it.

[Here](https://gist.github.com/davidamey/f7a26507ab1be93c394dc5d6941ee707?ts=4) are my answers to the [Go Tour](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1).
